  "description": "This was my first game developed using Unity. Although it started as a small project, my enthusiasm for game development and learning new things led me to constantly add new features. At some point, I couldn't stop myself, and the game started to grow uncontrollably. I began to feel like I couldn't see the end of the project and decided to halt development. While working on this first project, I learned a great deal, both technically and about the game development process itself.",
